# This repo does use at least one `.gitignore` file in a nested directory in the same repo.

# This is redundant, but it feels clearer to include `.DS_Store` explicitly.
.DS_Store
*
!.gitignore

# I gotta do this, or git will never even look in `.config`!
# See https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore.
!.config/

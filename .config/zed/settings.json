// For information on how to configure Zed, see the Zed
// documentation: https://zed.dev/docs/configuring-zed
//
// To see all of Zed's default settings without changing your
// custom settings, run `zed: open default settings` from the
// command palette (cmd-shift-p / ctrl-shift-p)
//
// My note: All of my configurations assume the availability of the default configuration for zed, including its comments, for me to understand them.
